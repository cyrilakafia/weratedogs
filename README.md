# Wrangle and Analyze Data
Project 2 for ALX - Udacity's Data Analyst Nano-Degree

## Data
The data was gathered from three different sources and in three different formats as described below:

1. The WeRateDogs Twitter archive. This file was provided by Udacity and was downloaded manually by clicking the following link: twitter_archive_enhanced.csv and was saved as a csv file.

2. The tweet image predictions. This file was hosted on Udacity's servers and was downloaded programmatically using the Requests library and the following URL: image_predictions.tsv and was saved as a tsv file.

3. Retweet and Favourite count for each tweet. This file was queried from Twitter's API using the Tweepy library and the tweet IDs in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive. The data was stored in a text file file.

The data was then accessed and cleaned using `pandas` and `numpy` basic functions and methods

Finally, visualizations were made on the cleaned data with `matplotlib` and `seaborn` after which the data was stored.
